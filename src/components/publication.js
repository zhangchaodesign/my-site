        'Nature has been a plentiful source of materials, replenishment, inspiration, and creativity. Nature collage, as a crafting technique, is a fun and educational activity for children to explore nature and engage their creativity. However, the raw material collection is limited to static things such as leaves, ignoring inspiration from nature sounds and dynamic elements such as babbling creeks. Using a mobile application, we hope to encourage children\'s creativity by renewing collage materials collection and careful observation in nature. To explore this, we conducted a formative study with children (N=20) and a design workshop with experts (N=6) to formulate NaCanva, an AI-assisted multi-modal collage creation system for children. Drawing on the interactivity between children and nature, NaCanva enables the multi-modal material collection, including images, sound, and videos, which differs our system from traditional collages. We validated this system with a between-subject user study (N=30), and the results suggested that NaCanva unleashes children\'s creativity in nature collage creation by enhancing children\'s multidimensional observation and engagement in nature.',

However, it is challenging for them to make and document their observations due to a lack of observation and drawing skills. Therefore, we designed an interactive drawing tool, Bio Sketchbook, which scaffolds children in systematic observation, observational drawing, and knowledge acquisition. It can recognize plant species and generate contour drawings from children’s photographs, guiding them to observe and draw multi-dimensional plant features with a digital magnifier and in-context biological information. Our in-situ user study with 19 children revealed that Bio Sketchbook provided an engaging experience and effectively supported children in recording and retaining biodiversity information and in balancing observations with screen time. Additionally, Bio Sketchbook intervened in children’s interaction with plants by prompting observational behaviors, encouraging them to directly touch and establish rapport with plants, and arousing their interest and knowledge of plants.',

These objects can have transformable properties by adopting different materials and be interactive by integrating electronic circuits. However, circuits in laser-cut objects always have limited movements, which refrains laser cutting from achieving interactive prototypes with more complex movable functions like mechanisms. We propose MechCircuit, a design and fabrication pipeline for making mechanical-electronical objects with laser cutting. We leverage the neodymium magnet's natures of magnetism and conductivity to integrate electronics and mechanical structure joints into prototypes. We conduct the evaluation to explore technological parameters and assess the practical feasibility of the fabrication pipeline. And we organized a user-observing workshop for non-expert users. Through the outcoming prototypes, the result demonstrates the feasibility of MechCircuit as a useful and inspiring prototyping method.",

        "Visual storytelling is a new approach to creative expression based on verbal and figural creativity. The keys to visual storytelling are narrating and drawing over a period of time, which can be beneficial but also demanding on creativity for children. Informed by need-finding investigations, we developed StoryDrawer, a co-creative system that supports visual storytelling for children aged 6-10 years through collaborative drawing between children and artificial intelligence (AI). The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children's telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content. We conducted a 2 x 2 study with 64 children to evaluate the efficacy of StoryDrawer by varying the two strategies in four conditions. The results suggest that StoryDrawer provoked participants' creative and elaborate ideas and contributed to their creative outcomes during an engaging visual storytelling experience.",

Based on the design concept of synesthesia from vision to hearing, we propose an application by which children aged 4-6 can create collages by matching different images of scenes and animals. The information contained in the created collages is then used as input parameters for generating music so as to create melodies that correspond to the collages. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative user study with children (n=6) by using our initial prototype. We concluded that the proposed application helps cultivate children's willingness to create melodies, and helps children better perceive and understand music by combining scenes and animal images in the collages.",

        "One key strategy of combating obesity is to slow down eating; however, this is difficult to achieve due to people's habitual nature. In this paper, we explored the feasibility of incorporating shape-changing interface into an eating spoon to directly intervene in undesirable eating behaviour. First, we investigated the optimal dimension (i.e., Z-depth) and ideal range of spoon transformation for different food forms that could affect bite size while maintaining usability. Those findings allowed the development of SSpoon prototype through a series of design explorations that are optimised for user's adoption. Then, we applied two shape-changing strategies: instant transformations based on food forms and subtle transformations based on food intake) and examined in two comparative studies involving a full course meal using Wizard-of-Oz approach. The results indicated that SSpoon could achieve comparable effects to a small spoon (5ml) in reducing eating rate by 13.7-16.1% and food consumption by 4.4-4.6%, while retaining similar user satisfaction as a normal eating spoon (10ml). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a shape-changing eating utensil as a promising alternative to combat the growing concern of obesity.",

        'The fabrication of underwater devices is necessary for the exploration of water environments and interactions in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) ﬁeld. However, there are fewer approaches to support prototyping used in water environments. The existing prototype methods lack systematic waterproof treatments and provide insufﬁcient software for balance and buoyancy analysis. To address these limitations, we present ElectroPaper, a new approach for the design and fabrication of prototypes used in water environments (surface or beneath) with paper-based electronic interfaces with a crease layer, hardware distribution layer, and hollow-out layer to support physical properties, such as waterprooﬁng, foldability, and conformability. The approach includes a computational design tool for assisting in balance analysis, three-dimensional (3D) model unfolding, and circuit drawing. We describe the design and fabrication process and provide several example applications to illustrate the feasibility and utility of our approach. ElectroPaper provides an inexpensive and effective medium for the fabrication of customized digital prototypes for water environment use.',

        "Visual storytelling is a new approach to creative expression based on verbal and figural creativity. The keys to visual storytelling are narrating and drawing over a period of time, which can be beneficial but also demanding on creativity for children. Informed by need-finding investigations, we developed StoryDrawer, a co-creative system that supports visual storytelling for children aged 6-10 years through collaborative drawing between children and artificial intelligence (AI). The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children's telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content. We conducted a 2 x 2 study with 64 children to evaluate the efficacy of StoryDrawer by varying the two strategies in four conditions. The results suggest that StoryDrawer provoked participants' creative and elaborate ideas and contributed to their creative outcomes during an engaging visual storytelling experience.",

        "Laser cutting revolutionizes the creation of personal-fabricated prototypes. These objects can have transformable properties by adopting different materials and be interactive by integrating electronic circuits. However, circuits in laser-cut objects always have limited movements, which refrains laser cutting from achieving interactive prototypes with more complex movable functions like mechanisms. We propose MechCircuit, a design and fabrication pipeline for making mechanical-electronical objects with laser cutting. We leverage the neodymium magnet's natures of magnetism and conductivity to integrate electronics and mechanical structure joints into prototypes. We conduct the evaluation to explore technological parameters and assess the practical feasibility of the fabrication pipeline. And we organized a user-observing workshop for non-expert users. Through the outcoming prototypes, the result demonstrates the feasibility of MechCircuit as a useful and inspiring prototyping method.",

        "One key strategy of combating obesity is to slow down eating; however, this is difficult to achieve due to people's habitual nature. In this paper, we explored the feasibility of incorporating shape-changing interface into an eating spoon to directly intervene in undesirable eating behaviour. First, we investigated the optimal dimension (i.e., Z-depth) and ideal range of spoon transformation for different food forms that could affect bite size while maintaining usability. Those findings allowed the development of SSpoon prototype through a series of design explorations that are optimised for user's adoption. Then, we applied two shape-changing strategies: instant transformations based on food forms and subtle transformations based on food intake) and examined in two comparative studies involving a full course meal using Wizard-of-Oz approach. The results indicated that SSpoon could achieve comparable effects to a small spoon (5ml) in reducing eating rate by 13.7-16.1% and food consumption by 4.4-4.6%, while retaining similar user satisfaction as a normal eating spoon (10ml). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a shape-changing eating utensil as a promising alternative to combat the growing concern of obesity.",

It can provide useful information, whether the user forgets where the object is or because someone else has moved the object.

Based on the design concept of synesthesia from vision to hearing, we propose an application by which children aged 4-6 can create collages by matching different images of scenes and animals. The information contained in the created collages is then used as input parameters for generating music so as to create melodies that correspond to the collages. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative user study with children (n=6) by using our initial prototype. We concluded that the proposed application helps cultivate children's willingness to create melodies, and helps children better perceive and understand music by combining scenes and animal images in the collages.",

The existing prototype methods lack systematic waterproof treatments and provide insufﬁcient software for balance and buoyancy analysis. To address these limitations, we present ElectroPaper, a new approach for the design and fabrication of prototypes used in water environments (surface or beneath) with paper-based electronic interfaces with a crease layer, hardware distribution layer, and hollow-out layer to support physical properties, such as waterprooﬁng, foldability, and conformability. The approach includes a computational design tool for assisting in balance analysis, three-dimensional (3D) model unfolding, and circuit drawing. We describe the design and fabrication process and provide several example applications to illustrate the feasibility and utility of our approach. ElectroPaper provides an inexpensive and effective medium for the fabrication of customized digital prototypes for water environment use.',

StoryDrawer works with children in two strategies: Child says and AI draws; and Child scribbles and AI completes. These two collaborative strategies allow children to draw their stories as an externalization and provoke unexpected ideas. This paper presents the interaction design, collaborative strategies and implementation of StoryDrawer, and conducts a user study for the fun and task effectiveness of StoryDrawer. The results reveal that our system can encourage children's active participation in storytelling and help them create novel stories through human-computer collaboration.",

The system scans the vitiligo area with the Light Detection and Ranging scanner to generate the 3D skin surface model and obtain the white patches image. Users can design their own tattoos or choose recommended designs that are available in the gallery to match up the pattern and the white patches’ shape through the application that is linked to the system.
