        I am a Ph.D. student at
        <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, adivsed by <a href="http://jeffrz.com/">Jeff Rzeszotarski</a>. I serve as both a UX designer and an HCI researcher. As a <span class="phrase_highlight">UX DESIGNER</span>, my designs have been recognized in esteemed design competitions such as Red
        Dot, iF, and Aâ€™ Design, and featured at notable events including
        Dubai Design Week and China Design Exhibition. As an
        <span class="phrase_highlight">HCI RESEARCHER</span>, I have published in reputable
        HCI venues like CHI, CSCW, IMWUT, IDC, and MobileHCI. I am also fortunate to have worked alongside distinguished professors such as <a href="https://ying-xu.com/">Ying Xu</a>,

            With an interdisciplinary background in Design Engineering (M.E. from
            <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>), Electrical
            Engineering (B.E. from

            <a href="https://english.jiangnan.edu.cn/">Jiangnan University</a>), my
            research interest primarily lies in Human-AI Interaction & Design.
            Specifically,
            <b
              >I delve into the use of generative AI as design materials aiming to foster
              responsible interactions that empower users, especially kids, to create, learn, and flourish.</b
            >
            <!-- For instance, I have successfully designed educational technologies,
            leveraging generative AI to engage young individuals in creative
            interventions, STEM learning, and nature-oriented explorations. -->
            <!-- Previously, I designed AI-fused
            systems to augment human cognition and action, and conducted
            empirical studies to understand human perception. -->

              <b>Human-AI Interaction</b>: My first research interest is exploring
              human-AI collaborative approaches to augment human capabilities of cognition
              (e.g., creativity, engagement), perception (e.g., observation), and action
              (e.g., design).

              <b>Digital Youth</b>: My second research interest is designing interactive
              technologies to scaffold children in creating, learning, and understanding
              the world. For example, I developed AI-fused creativity support tools (CSTs)
              that engage children in creativity activities such as visual storytelling,
              music composition, and observational drawing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Design</b>: My third research interest is investigating the impact of designs (e.g., dark patterns) on end users' daily online experience and inventing computational design tools to lower barriers to prototyping.
