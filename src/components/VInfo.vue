        I am an incoming Ph.D. student at
        <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, advised by the fabulous
        Professor <a href="https://qianyang.co/">Qian Yang</a>. As a
        <span class="phrase_highlight">UI/UX DESIGNER</span>, my designs has garnered
        accolades in renowned design competitions, including iF, DIA, and Aâ€™ Design, and
        have been showcased at prestigious events like Dubai Design Week and China Design
        Exhibition. As an <span class="phrase_highlight">HCI RESEARCHER</span>, I have
        published in esteemed HCI venues such as CHI, IMWUT, IDC, MobileHCI, etc. I am
        grateful to have collaborated with notable professors:
        <a href="https://toby.li/">Toby Jia-jun Li</a>,

            <!-- For instance, I have successfully designed educational technologies,
            leveraging generative AI to engage young individuals in creative
            interventions, STEM learning, and nature-oriented explorations. -->

            systems to augment human cognition and action, and conducted
