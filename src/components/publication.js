        "Online critique communities (OCCs) provide a convenient space for creators to solicit feedback on their artifacts and improve skills. Creators’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement with comments on their works contribute to their skill development. However, what kinds of critique creators feel engaging may change with the creation stage of their shared artifacts. In this paper, we first model three dimensions of engagement expressed in creators’ replies to peer comments. Then we quantitatively examine how their engagement is affected by artifacts’ stage and feedback characteristics via regression analysis. Results show that creators sharing works-in-progress tend to exhibit lower behavioral and emotional engagement, but higher cognitive engagement than those sharing complete works. The increase in the valence of the feedback is associated with a stronger increase in behavior engagement for seekers sharing complete works than works-in-progress. Finally, we discuss how our insights could benefit OCCs and other online help-seeking platforms.",

However, mathematical language in many families is poor. Through need-finding investigation, we developed MathKingdom, a voice-agent-based game that helps children aged 4–7 learn and use rich, accurate mathematical language (e.g., mathematical expressions related to measurement, sequence, patterns). The game has of four flows, in which users can wake up, transform, decorate, and perform as their avatars, as well as practice basic mathematical vocabulary, mathematical single sentences, coherent mathematical statements, and free expression. We refined the system design through Wizard-of-Oz testing and then evaluated it with 18 families. The results showed that MathKingdom effectively engaged children, enhanced their mathematical language skills and mathematical abilities, and encouraged parent-child conversations about math.",

        "Laser cutting revolutionizes the creation of personal-fabricated prototypes. These objects can have transformable properties by adopting different materials and be interactive by integrating electronic circuits. However, circuits in laser-cut objects always have limited movements, which refrains laser cutting from achieving interactive prototypes with more complex movable functions like mechanisms. We propose MechCircuit, a design and fabrication pipeline for making mechanical-electronical objects with laser cutting. We leverage the neodymium magnet's natures of magnetism and conductivity to integrate electronics and mechanical structure joints into prototypes. We conduct the evaluation to explore technological parameters and assess the practical feasibility of the fabrication pipeline. And we organized a user-observing workshop for non-expert users. Through the outcoming prototypes, the result demonstrates the feasibility of MechCircuit as a useful and inspiring prototyping method.",

        "Visual storytelling is a new approach to creative expression based on verbal and figural creativity. The keys to visual storytelling are narrating and drawing over a period of time, which can be beneficial but also demanding on creativity for children. Informed by need-finding investigations, we developed StoryDrawer, a co-creative system that supports visual storytelling for children aged 6-10 years through collaborative drawing between children and artificial intelligence (AI). The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children's telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content. We conducted a 2 x 2 study with 64 children to evaluate the efficacy of StoryDrawer by varying the two strategies in four conditions. The results suggest that StoryDrawer provoked participants' creative and elaborate ideas and contributed to their creative outcomes during an engaging visual storytelling experience.",

        "One key strategy of combating obesity is to slow down eating; however, this is difficult to achieve due to people's habitual nature. In this paper, we explored the feasibility of incorporating shape-changing interface into an eating spoon to directly intervene in undesirable eating behaviour. First, we investigated the optimal dimension (i.e., Z-depth) and ideal range of spoon transformation for different food forms that could affect bite size while maintaining usability. Those findings allowed the development of SSpoon prototype through a series of design explorations that are optimised for user's adoption. Then, we applied two shape-changing strategies: instant transformations based on food forms and subtle transformations based on food intake) and examined in two comparative studies involving a full course meal using Wizard-of-Oz approach. The results indicated that SSpoon could achieve comparable effects to a small spoon (5ml) in reducing eating rate by 13.7-16.1% and food consumption by 4.4-4.6%, while retaining similar user satisfaction as a normal eating spoon (10ml). These results demonstrate the feasibility of a shape-changing eating utensil as a promising alternative to combat the growing concern of obesity.",

        'The fabrication of underwater devices is necessary for the exploration of water environments and interactions in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) ﬁeld. However, there are fewer approaches to support prototyping used in water environments. The existing prototype methods lack systematic waterproof treatments and provide insufﬁcient software for balance and buoyancy analysis. To address these limitations, we present ElectroPaper, a new approach for the design and fabrication of prototypes used in water environments (surface or beneath) with paper-based electronic interfaces with a crease layer, hardware distribution layer, and hollow-out layer to support physical properties, such as waterprooﬁng, foldability, and conformability. The approach includes a computational design tool for assisting in balance analysis, three-dimensional (3D) model unfolding, and circuit drawing. We describe the design and fabrication process and provide several example applications to illustrate the feasibility and utility of our approach. ElectroPaper provides an inexpensive and effective medium for the fabrication of customized digital prototypes for water environment use.',

However, previous studies have focused on single-person scenarios without considering the influence of other people in public places. Based on the technology of object detection and face recognition, our system can help reduce the burden upon people's memory. It can provide useful information, whether the user forgets where the object is or because someone else has moved the object. The system includes a camera, processing server and smartphone application. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative user study with participants (n=12). We demonstrated the usability of this system in helping users find misplaced items in public settings with multiple people.",

Based on the design concept of synesthesia from vision to hearing, we propose an application by which children aged 4-6 can create collages by matching different images of scenes and animals. The information contained in the created collages is then used as input parameters for generating music so as to create melodies that correspond to the collages. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative user study with children (n=6) by using our initial prototype. We concluded that the proposed application helps cultivate children's willingness to create melodies, and helps children better perceive and understand music by combining scenes and animal images in the collages.",

StoryDrawer works with children in two strategies: Child says and AI draws; and Child scribbles and AI completes. These two collaborative strategies allow children to draw their stories as an externalization and provoke unexpected ideas. This paper presents the interaction design, collaborative strategies and implementation of StoryDrawer, and conducts a user study for the fun and task effectiveness of StoryDrawer. The results reveal that our system can encourage children's active participation in storytelling and help them create novel stories through human-computer collaboration.",
